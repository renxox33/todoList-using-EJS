A Todo list using EJS templates

Url: https://radiant-fjord-21177.herokuapp.com/

Accessing the url directs user to a 'Today' list.

Additionally, users have the option to create custom lists with a name of their own liking. 
To do this, the user just needs to append the url with the name of the list followed by a '/'.
For example, "https://radiant-fjord-21177.herokuapp.com/work" will create a custom list named 'work'.
